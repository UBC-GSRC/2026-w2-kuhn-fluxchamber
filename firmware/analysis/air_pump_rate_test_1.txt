This data came from a test in which two 12V air pumps were connected to the air chamber.
The air chamber did NOT have a water seal at the base so some CO2 was likely leaking from the poor
seal. But all of the wires at the top of the chamber were sealed using cable glands.

I took the first measurement, then exhaled into the chamber about 10 times. This saturated the sensor
to read 10,000 ppm. The rest is shown below.

NOTES:
- 2 air pumps, one pumping out one pumping in, simultaneously
- NO fan to circulate air

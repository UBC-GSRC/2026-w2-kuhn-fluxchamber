Kenzie is aiming to deploy 4 floating flux chambers on lakes in Northern BC / Southern Yukon. These flux chambers are to be deployed for the summer (approximately 3 months) and attended on infrequently (2-3 times a month). Inside the flux chamber will be sensors to measure CO2 and methane whose data will be saved to an SD card.

Automated CO2 & CH4 Flux Chamber for Boreal-Arctic Lakes

This is an environmental monitoring project. We will deploy a floating flux chambers on a sample lake to test the device before installing 4 chambers in Northern BC / Southern Yukon. Once testing in Malcolm Knapp is complete these flux chambers are to be deployed for the summer (approximately 3 months) and attended on infrequently (2-3 times a month). Inside the flux chamber will be sensors to measure Carbon Dioxide and Methane Flux. The testing at Malcolm Knapp will last approximately 2-3 Months and in that time we will get emissive flux from a lake while also training students and faculty on proper operative procedures.  

The PI for the project is Dr. McKenzie Kuhn from UBC geography

Kenzie is aiming to deploy 4 floating flux chambers on lakes in Northern BC / Southern Yukon. These flux chambers are to be deployed for the summer (approximately 3 months) and attended on infrequently (2-3 times a month). Inside the flux chamber will be sensors to measure CO2 and methane whose data will be saved to an SD card.

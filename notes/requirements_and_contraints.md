- How many systems do you want in an ideal world? One for each lake/ extras/ one for here? 

  - This depends a little bit on cost, but for this summer if we could manage 5-7 systems, I think that would be fantastic. If all goes well, I would love to make more next year so we can cover more of the spatial variability across individual lakes. 

- For how long do you want to deploy the sensors? At what frequency do you want to record measurements? 

  - We are considering deploying them for ~3 months (June-August) and would be able to check on them 1-2 times per month. For sensor frequency, I think we could get away with every 1-2 minutes while the chamber is closed, but let me know if this sounds reasonable. Higher frequency would be better (5-30 seconds). If this seems like a bit of a stretch for this first summer, we could also deploy them for a week each trip (we have three trips planned) and then take them out of the lakes in between trips.  

- Do you have a preference if we make the Automated Ebullition Counter as described by Nguyen et al. or did you imagine that we would only have a flux chamber and use data analysis to extract ebullition events as described by So et al.? 

  - While the ebullition design is tempting, many of our study lakes have quite low ebullitive fluxes, so I think we should focus on the chamber component for now. Along these lines, I do not think we need a bubble shield like some other folks have designed into their systems 

- Do you have an idea of why people are making such convoluted designs (e.g. accordion, inflatable tubes to tilt the chambers)  to vent the gas in the flux chamber?  

  - Not really! The accordion design I think came from an undergraduate group who was not as familiar with ghg exchange work. My colleague said she is very hesitant about the design because she is not sure if the accordion material is leak proof. I think we can come up with something better 

- Do you want a home station on the lake shore instead of needing to check on the sensors mid-lake? 

  - Is it possible to deploy the chambers at the center of the lake and have the home station on the shoreline? If so I think this is definitely a good choice (the less equipment on the lake the better) 

- Do you want your data to be uploaded to a cloud database or only stored locally on an SD card? 

  - I will follow your lead on this. The old school part of me feels most comfortable with SD cards, but I can be convinced otherwise! Is it possible to do both?
